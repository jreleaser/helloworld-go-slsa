  ** `windows-amd64`

 * assemble zip distributions with JReleaser
 * create rolling early-access releases with JReleaser on every push to `main` branch
 * generate SLSA attestation upon release

IMPORTANT: JReleaser requires 2 additional inputs that may be set as environment variables, `JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION` and `JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN`. 
More information about environment variable configuration may be found in the link:https://jreleaser.org/guide/latest/reference/environment.html[guide].
